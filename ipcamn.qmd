The `Integrated Phase Classification of Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN)` provides key information for decision makers that focuses on short to long-term objectives to decrease acute malnutrition. Together with the IPC Acute Food Insecurity,  the IPC Acute Malnutrition classification also provides information on acute food insecurity, making IPC an inclusive classification system to inform both acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition.

The 2024 IPC Analysis Workshop is scheduled to be held in Juba, South Sudan from `Sept 10th to 25th 2024`.
